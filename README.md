# What is Fizzbuz?
Fizz Buzz is a game where players sit in a circle and count up to a certain number. However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by both become fizz buzz. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.

In these solutions there is obviously only one player, the script, but it's funny to program nevertheless. 

`solution1.php` is the first solution I came up with. It follow the rules exactly.

`solution2.php` is a little bit more advanced, you can add any amount of rules with number to divide and which word to replace them with.
